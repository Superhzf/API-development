Q: What is the difference between Python instance v.s. static v.s. class methods
A: Instance methods are the most common type of methods in Python. It must have self as a parameter. These are so called
because they can access unique data of their instance. If you have two objects each created from a car class,
then they each may have different properties. They may have different colors, engine sizes, seats, and so on.

For example,

class DecoratorExample:
  """ Example Class """
  def __init__(self):
    """ Example Setup """
    print('Hello, World!')
    self.name = 'Decorator_Example'

  def example_function(self):
    """ This method is an instance method! """
    print('I\'m an instance method!')
    print('My name is ' + self.name)

de = DecoratorExample()
de.example_function()

Static methods are methods that are related to a class. You don't have to use self. You don't need to instantiate a class.
@staticmethod decorator was used to tell Python that this method is a static method. They cannot access class data. They
should be completely self-contained. They can only access parameters provided.

For example,

class DecoratorExample:
  """ Example Class """
  def __init__(self):
    """ Example Setup """
    print('Hello, World!')

  @staticmethod
  def example_function():
    """ This method is a static method! """
    print('I\'m a static method!')

de = DecoratorExample.example_function()

When is it a good time to use static methods?
Use static methods if you have something that could be written as a standalone function (not part of any class),
but you want to keep it within the class because it's somehow semantically related to the class.

Class methods know about their class, They CANNOT access specific instance data, but they CAN call other static methods.
Class methods do not need self, they do need a parameter cls. This stands for class.

For example,

class DecoratorExample:
  """ Example Class """
  def __init__(self):
    """ Example Setup """
    print('Hello, World!')

  @classmethod
  def example_function(cls):
    """ This method is a class method! """
    print('I\'m a class method!')
    cls.some_other_function()

  @staticmethod
    def some_other_function():
    print('Hello!')

de = DecoratorExample()
de.example_function()

When to use class methods?
Class methods are for when you need to have methods that aren't specific to any particular instance, but still involve
the class in some way.


In summary:
Instance Methods: The most common method type. Able to access data and properties unique to each instance.
Static Methods: Cannot access anything else in the class. Totally self-contained code.
Class Methods: Can access limited methods in the class. Can modify class specific details.
